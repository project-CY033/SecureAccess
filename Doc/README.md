# CyberSecurity Monitoring Platform

## Overview

A comprehensive cybersecurity monitoring platform built with Flask that provides real-time system monitoring, network traffic analysis, application scanning, and advanced security tools. The platform implements AI-enhanced threat detection, real-time monitoring, and automated security analysis capabilities.

## Features

### Core Monitoring Capabilities
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage tracking with performance metrics
- **Advanced Process Monitoring**: Malicious activity detection with risk assessment algorithms
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Connection monitoring with security threat evaluation
- **Application Security Scanning**: APK/EXE file analysis with comprehensive threat detection
- **Browser Security Monitoring**: Automatic website security checks and activity tracking
- **Application Permissions Analysis**: Hidden permission detection and risk assessment

### Security Intelligence
- **SecurityAI Tools Collection**: AI-enhanced cybersecurity tools including subdomain enumeration
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Automated analysis of suspicious activities
- **Comprehensive Alert System**: Multi-level notification system with severity classification
- **API Security Monitoring**: Detailed usage statistics and vulnerability scanning

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with real-time JavaScript updates
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive data models
- **Security Libraries**: psutil, requests, dns, cryptography
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for live updates

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture with separated concerns:
 


## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Access the platform at `http://localhost:5000`
