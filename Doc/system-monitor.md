# System Monitor - Real-time System Metrics

## Overview
The System Monitor provides comprehensive real-time analysis of system performance and security metrics, implementing advanced algorithms for threat detection and performance optimization.

## Methodology

### Performance Metrics Collection
The system monitor employs continuous polling mechanisms using the `psutil` library to gather accurate system performance data:

1. **CPU Utilization Analysis**: Multi-core CPU usage tracking with per-core breakdown
2. **Memory Management Monitoring**: Virtual and physical memory analysis with swap usage
3. **Disk I/O Performance**: Read/write operations monitoring with throughput analysis
4. **Network Interface Monitoring**: Bandwidth utilization and packet analysis

### Algorithm Implementation

#### CPU Performance Analysis Algorithm
```python
def analyze_cpu_performance():
    cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1, percpu=True)
    cpu_times = psutil.cpu_times()
    
    # Calculate CPU efficiency score
    efficiency_score = calculate_efficiency(cpu_percent, cpu_times)
    
    # Detect CPU anomalies
    anomalies = detect_cpu_anomalies(cpu_percent)
    
    # Generate performance recommendations
    recommendations = generate_cpu_recommendations(efficiency_score, anomalies)
    
    return {
        'usage': cpu_percent,
        'efficiency': efficiency_score,
        'anomalies': anomalies,
        'recommendations': recommendations
    }
```

#### Memory Optimization Algorithm
```python
def analyze_memory_usage():
    memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
    swap = psutil.swap_memory()
    
    # Calculate memory pressure score
    pressure_score = (memory.percent * 0.7) + (swap.percent * 0.3)
    
    # Identify memory-intensive processes
    high_memory_processes = get_high_memory_processes()
    
    # Detect memory leaks
    leak_indicators = detect_memory_leaks(high_memory_processes)
    
    return {
        'pressure_score': pressure_score,
        'high_usage_processes': high_memory_processes,
        'leak_indicators': leak_indicators
    }
```

### Security Integration

#### System Security Assessment
The system monitor incorporates security analysis into performance monitoring:

1. **Process Behavior Analysis**: Identifies unusual process patterns
2. **Resource Usage Anomalies**: Detects potential malware through resource consumption
3. **System Call Monitoring**: Tracks suspicious system interactions
4. **Performance-based Threat Detection**: Links performance degradation to security issues

## How It Works

### Data Collection Pipeline
1. **Hardware Interface**: Direct communication with system hardware through OS APIs
2. **Data Normalization**: Raw metrics converted to standardized formats
3. **Historical Comparison**: Current metrics compared against baseline performance
4. **Trend Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms identify performance patterns

### Real-time Processing
- **Sampling Rate**: Metrics collected every second for real-time accuracy
- **Buffer Management**: Circular buffers maintain recent performance history
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Automatic alerts when metrics exceed defined limits
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic adjustment of monitoring sensitivity

### Performance Optimization
The system implements intelligent caching and processing optimization:
- **Lazy Loading**: Expensive calculations performed only when needed
- **Data Compression**: Historical data compressed for efficient storage
- **Query Optimization**: Database queries optimized for real-time performance

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Multi-threading**: Separate threads for different metric collection
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for UI responsiveness
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures to minimize overhead
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling for system API failures

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE system_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cpu_percent FLOAT NOT NULL,
    memory_percent FLOAT NOT NULL,
    disk_percent FLOAT NOT NULL,
    network_sent BIGINT NOT NULL,
    network_recv BIGINT NOT NULL,
    active_processes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Data Protection
- System metrics filtered to exclude sensitive information
- Access controls limit monitoring data to authorized users
- Audit logging tracks all system monitoring activities
- Encryption protects stored performance data

## Visualization Components
