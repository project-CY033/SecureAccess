    while monitoring_active:
        # Collect system metrics using psutil
        system_metrics = collect_system_metrics()
        
        # Analyze running processes for threats
        process_analysis = analyze_running_processes()
        
        # Monitor network connections
        network_activity = monitor_network_connections()
        
        # AI-powered threat assessment
        threat_assessment = comprehensive_threat_analysis(
            system_metrics, network_activity, process_analysis
        )
        
        # Generate alerts if threats detected
        if threat_assessment['threat_score'] > ALERT_THRESHOLD:
            generate_security_alert(threat_assessment)
```

## Algorithm and Logic Questions

### Q9: Explain your threat scoring algorithm.
**Answer:**
```python

        'suspicious_process_behavior': 0.30,
        'network_activity_risk': 0.25,
        'file_integrity_violations': 0.20
    }
    
    threat_score = 0
    for factor, weight in risk_factors.items():
        threat_score += metrics[factor] * weight
    
    # Normalize to 0-100 scale
    return min(max(threat_score, 0), 100)
