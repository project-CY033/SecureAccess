## Overview

The CY033-PC Security Suite is a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that provides a range of simulated security features to help users monitor and protect their system.  It includes tools for system monitoring, web filtering, application protection, data sanitization, access control, and alert management.  **Important Note:** This application is primarily a simulation and educational tool. While it incorporates many concepts of real-world security applications, it does not provide actual system protection in the same way that commercial security software does. It uses simulated data and simplified implementations for many of its features.  It does, however, leverage the VirusTotal API for enhanced file and URL scanning (requires a VirusTotal API key).

## Features

The application is organized into several tabs, each offering different security-related functionality:

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Monitor:**  Simulates real-time monitoring of system processes.  Displays process ID (PID), name, executable path, user, CPU usage, memory usage, status, and creation time.  Includes simulated network traffic monitoring and detection of suspicious process behavior (e.g., high resource usage, connections to malicious IPs, attempts to access sensitive files).  Allows process termination (simulation).  Monitors for changes to sensitive files.
*   **üì± App Shield:** Simulates monitoring of app installations. Analyzes apps for potential risks (clone, fake, malicious) based on simulated heuristics and a basic malicious app database.  Simulates blocking the installation of malicious apps.
*   **üåê Web Guard:** Monitors web activity (simulated browsing history) and provides a basic web filtering functionality to make web activity safe.
*   **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Web Filtering:** Simulates advanced, real-time web security.  Includes simulated reputation checks (using a local database and VirusTotal), content analysis (keyword detection, obfuscated JavaScript detection, XSS attempt detection, SQL injection attempt detection), and dynamic updating of malicious domain lists.  Simulates blocking malicious websites and warning about suspicious content.  Includes a simulated download scanner using VirusTotal. Generates reports.
*   **üîí Data Protection:**  Provides tools for data sanitization and simulated data backup/encryption.  Allows users to add files, process them to redact sensitive information (SSN, credit card numbers, phone numbers, email addresses), and set data retention policies.  Simulates automated data backup and file encryption.
*   **üö´ Access Control:** Simulates basic access control features, including a placeholder for user/role/permission management and a simulated multi-factor authentication (MFA) login process.
*   **üì¶ Applications:** Simulates listing installed applications, including potentially "hidden" ones.  Includes placeholder buttons for uninstalling, updating, and viewing permissions (these buttons currently only print to the console). Includes simulated vulnerability scanning and application sandboxing.
*   **üö® Alerts:**  Displays security alerts generated by other modules.  Provides detailed information about each alert (description, timestamp, severity, source).  Allows users to acknowledge and clear alerts.
*   **‚öô Settings:**  Allows users to customize data sanitization patterns (add/remove regular expressions for sensitive data) and enable/disable auto-redaction.  Includes a setting to control the update interval for the Monitor tab.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7 or higher
*   Tkinter (usually included with Python)
*   Required Python Packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
    *   `Pillow` (for image processing)
    *   `PyMuPDF` (for PDF processing, also known as `fitz`)
    *   `python-docx` (for Word document processing)
    *   `opencv-python` (for video processing - currently a placeholder)
    *   `pdfrw` (for PDF processing)
    *   `pytesseract` (for OCR - Optical Character Recognition)
    *   `requests` (for making HTTP requests)
    *   `psutil` (for system and process monitoring)
    *   `virustotal-api` (for interacting with the VirusTotal API)

*   **Tesseract OCR Engine:** You *must* install the Tesseract OCR engine separately. This is *not* a Python package.  Instructions for installing Tesseract can be found here: [https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)
    *   **Important:** After installing Tesseract, make sure it's added to your system's `PATH` environment variable.  Without this, `pytesseract` will not be able to find it.
*   **VirusTotal API Key:**  You will need a valid VirusTotal API key to use the VirusTotal integration features. You can obtain a free API key by creating an account on the VirusTotal website: [https://www.virustotal.com/](https://www.virustotal.com/)
    * **Important:** Replace the placeholder API key in `data_processor.py`, `web_filtering.py`, and `monitor.py` with your actual API key. Look for the line: `self.vt = VirusTotalAPI("YOUR_API_KEY")`

# Installation  Staps 

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download):**

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/project-CY033/project-SecureAccess.git
    cd  project-SecureAccess

    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv  # Or any name you prefer for the environment
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- ###  Verify the installation by running:
```
pip show PyQt5

```


- ### install Requriment if not exists
```
pip install PyQt5 scapy psutil

```


- ### Run
```
python main.py
```



5. Install Tesseract OCR engine
6. Put your virustotal API key.

## Usage

1.  **Activate the Virtual Environment** (if you created one):
    Follow the activation steps from the Installation section.

2.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Explore the Tabs:** The application will open with a tabbed interface.  Navigate through the different tabs to explore the various features.

## Important Considerations (Simulations)

This application is designed for educational and simulation purposes.  Many of its features are *simulations* of real-world security tools.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Monitoring:**  While `psutil` provides *real* system information, the analysis of this information (e.g., "suspicious process" detection) is based on simplified rules.  The network monitoring is also simplified.
*   **Web Filtering:**  The application *simulates* browser activity.  It does *not* integrate with a real web browser. The content analysis and reputation checks are also simulations, although the VirusTotal integration is real.
*   **App Shield:**  The "app installation" and analysis are simulated. The application does not actually prevent app installations on your system.
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   The "redaction" performed by the Data Sanitizer modifies copies of files in a temporary directory.
    *   The "backup" is a simulated file copy.
    *   The "encryption" is a placeholder and does *not* provide real cryptographic security.
*   **Access Control:** The MFA is a simulation. It does not connect to any real authentication service.
*   **Application Tab:**  The application listing, vulnerability scanning, and sandboxing features are simulations.
